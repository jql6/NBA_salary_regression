# NBA salary regression analysis
Regression analysis on 2020-2021 NBA salaries using 2019-2020 box score data. There are two coding files; the first is the [scraper](https://github.com/jql6/NBA_salary_regression/blob/main/salary_scraper.py) and the second is [the analysis](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1pCPfY6VaR6cS-8a1E8UiChtZLPn2pq9H#scrollTo=-BZP8Y9gIDoi).
